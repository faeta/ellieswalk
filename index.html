		<p>Ellie was born on Christmas Day 2011 weighing 10lb and appearing fit & healthy. At her 6 week check, Ellie’s Mum, Jenny, told the doctor that she was concerned with her breathing despite being told by doctors and health visitors that everything was fine. After examining Ellie, the doctor referred her to Bath Royal United Hospital. Ellie was diagnosed with Common Arterial Trunk  (Truncus Arteriosus) and needed open heart surgery to save her life. Ellie was transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital, and had the major operation in March 2012. </p> <br>
		<p>Ellie is a little fighter and is doing very well, her family couldn’t be more proud of her. Unfortunately she will need further operations as she gets older since the piece put in during the operation will not grow with her and will need to be replaced.</p><br>
		<p>Ellie and her family would like to raise money for the British Heart Foundation, and Ellie’s Walk has become an annual event since 2012. It takes place at Worthy Farm in Pilton (the home of the Glastonbury Festival), and is a 1.5 mile long walk followed by tea and cake. </p><br>
		<p>Ellie’s Walk also raises money for Bristol Children’s Hospital.</p>
